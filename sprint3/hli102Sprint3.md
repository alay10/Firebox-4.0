- [User Interface #34](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/FireBox/issues/34)

### What you did not do

- Pause Main need need to be combined with the previous pause button (exit button)

### What problems you encountered

- Music needs a dedicated channel to manage, instead of playing background music every time the scene is switched, the music in the options menu and main menu should be consistent instead of restarting playback

### Summary

Heath issues need base on hit box, and UI is a combination of many problems. I have initially completed the pause interface, just need to add keyboard input to complete it, and finally I may need to add sound options and brightness options. In the options interface, the game is over. Finally, I also hope to complete the sound system.
