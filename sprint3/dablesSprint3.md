# Sprint 3

Name: Dylan Ables
Github ID: Dables1
Team Name: FireBox

### What you planned to do

- [Polish the Kick #52](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/FireBox/issues/52)
- [Fireball Animation #58](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/FireBox/issues/58)
- [Fireball Startup Frames #59](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/FireBox/issues/59)

### What you did not do

- The animation for the fireball needs to be flipped for left side player.

### What problems you encountered

Github was a nightmare, generally fighting with that.
Also getting the fireball startup time was a bit of a struggle, the animation is still backwards for left player.
