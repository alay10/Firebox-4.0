# Sprint 3
- Name: Andrew Lay
- Githubid: alay10
- Group name: Firebox
- --
 ## What I did
- Fixed dashing
- Added command inputs on the fireball and low kick
- Added a crouching animation
- Attempted to add blocking but is not fully working
- Shrunk the player to match the faster paced gameplay
## What I did not do
- Get blocking to work
- Add a parry
## Problems
- I could not get the blocking hitbox to interact the way that I wanted it to
- I just did not have much time for this sprint and was not able to add very much to the project

 # Summery
I think that this sprint went okay but I think that we all know we should have met more. I also wished that I had more time for this sprint. There is not much to say about this one, each member just got what they needed to do, done and that was about it.
