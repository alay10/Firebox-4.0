To open for development, download Godot and import the `project.godot` file.


#### **Style Guide for code:**

**All Changes should be commit'd to your own branch and then merged into the main in order to prevent accidental conflicts**
Merges should be overseen by a **minimum of two people** counting the author of the branch.
Before overwriting someone else's code on main you should double check your changes with them

We will just be using the Godot reccomended style guide found [here.](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html)
