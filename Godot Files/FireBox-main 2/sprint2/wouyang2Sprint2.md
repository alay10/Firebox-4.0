# Sprint 2
- Name: Weilin Ouyang
- Github ID: wouyang2 
- Team Name: Firebox 

## What do you planned to do:
- [Creating AI](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/FireBox/issues/32)
- [Play State Handling](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/FireBox/issues/35)
- [Auto turnaround ](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/FireBox/issues/25)

## Things that I did not finished 
- In sprint 2, I finished most of the tasks. Since the play state handling is embedded in the Godot Engine, it did not take me a lot to implement it into our project and for the auto turnaround, we discuss about it and eventually we decide to dispose this issue because manually adjust the direction of boxes would be much easier to implement

## What problems you encounters
- In sprint 2, we have much more communication, the problems I encountered are the complication of the AI. And since our game do not have health bar and hit box overlap yet, they becomes the obstacle of finishing AI setting  
## Issues you worked on 
- [AI Script](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/FireBox/issues/32)

## Files you worked on 
- https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/FireBox/blob/main/Godot_Files/Game/Scripts/AI.gd

## What you accompulished 
- In this sprint, I have done much more than I have in the sprint 1. Our game is about 60% done, all we need is finishing the core feature of the game.
