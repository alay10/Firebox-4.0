 ## What I did
- implemented extremely simple animations.
- Implemented player input with a controller
- Worked to make the project overall more module with the movement as a example
## What I did not do
- Implement a full developer console/debug menu. This just ended up not making sense yet
- Make nice animations that will scale with other features
## Problems
- Godot proved to be more confusing to work with than expected
- Inputs are not being handled properly because we need to fix how sides are being handled
- Overwriting others files due to the way that Godot handles overhead files seems odd so we started
 working in branches
 - Having one script work on many objects seemed to be not how we expected it to be
 - Getting times together to meet was hard and out group lacked a sense of leadership
 ### Issues
 - [controller support](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/FireBox/commit/f07fa9faf39d35249f5862f381a81d3ee87eeb59)
 - [animations](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/FireBox/commit/bf1d5ae1487eedc79ee76b95563e8207adf99c47)
 - I worked on making a dev console but as listed above I did not fully integrate it yet so no specific commit

 # Summery
 I was able to add a lot to the input handling for the game with keyboard and controller support. I also felt that did my best to bring some kind of leadership to the group and it is the number one thing that I want to accomplish for the next sprint. This sprint was mainly spent trying to find when to meet and figuring out how to work Godot.
