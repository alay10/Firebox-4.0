# Sprint 2

Name: Dylan Ables
Github ID: Dables1
Team Name: FireBox

### What you planned to do

- Make the kickBox animation: [Attack Animations - Kick #30](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/FireBox/issues/30)
- Make hit detection for the kickBox: [Be able to detect hitbox, hurtbox overlap #14](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/FireBox/issues/14)
- Assign the music to the scenes: [Sound - Music #28](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/FireBox/issues/28)

### What you did not do

- Make hit detection for the kickBox: [Be able to detect hitbox, hurtbox overlap #14](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/FireBox/issues/14)

### What problems you encountered

Making the hit detection was significantly harder than I had anticipated, and was working with tools I was unfamiliar with- I had to resign from this issue. I had made the animations, but could not put them into the game- an issue that has been resolved. P2 animations are still off, but those are an easy fix.
