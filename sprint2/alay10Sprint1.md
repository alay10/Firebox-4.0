# Sprint 2
- Name: Andrew Lay
- Githubid: alay10
- Group name: Firebox

 ## What I did
- Created an options menu
- Options menu is able to bind controls
- Added a system to flip direction as well as better animation system
- Added a buffering system that allows for a dash
- Added dashing
## What I did not do
- I was hoping to be able to some more with the buffering system
## Problems
- I forgot to push one of my changes untill much later (Not much of an issue just though tI would mention)
- Created a crazy glitch with the way the dash happens
- If you attack at the end of the dash you will contenue to slide
- checking for the side swap should probably change
- Changing varible names will likly become more of an issue in the future but for now its fine

 # Summery
I was very happy about the progress I made in this sprint. The dashing works pretty intuitively and the options works exactly how I want it too. Really the only issues that I had was when trying to have meeting with the other club member but most of the work I had to do wasn't too conected to anyone else. I am excited for the next sprint because there are many new things to work on based on what was added in this sprint.
