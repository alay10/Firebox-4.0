# Product Requirements Document
Name: Bee Bussell

Product Name: Firebox

## Background
Firebox is a simplified fighting game that works as a fast paced realtime rock paper scissors game.
The game revolves around the fireball, or in this case the firebox(tm), that is thrown by the player.
The game flows based on how each player responds to the fireball. The small simplified nature of the fighting game
combined with the balanced and thought out tools allows experience fighting game players and newcomers alike to 
enjoy the game and have fun.

## Project Overview
A simplified fighting game that revolves around our Firebox. Based on the triangle of, Jump beats fireball, 
uppercut beats jump, fireball beats uppercut. From there other moves have been added for seasoning with the core
of the game being found in those three moves. Featuring player customization and remapable controls for convience 
our game also works with controllers
Describe the proposed project. You can use the same description that your group uses in the final project README.md. The rest should be your own work,
but the project overview can be the same for everyone in the group.

## Features
1. **Character Customization** As a player I have a hard time telling apart similarly shaped characters so I use the character customization to change the colors to be extra bright
2. **Dashing** As a player I like fast paced games luckly this game has a dashing feature so I can go fast
3. **Blocking** As a camper I like hiding in the corner and playing as lame as possible luckily this games block option is busted!
4. **Instant Overhead** Personally I really like taking a move everyone thinks is useless and using it in creative ways, thats why I'm glad this game has an instant overhead
5. **Uppercut** My favorite part of fighting Ken is when I can see the obvious jump in happening, luckily this game has an excellent way for me to counter that jump in.
6. **Fireball** I really wish there was a way for me to light my opponent on fire, luckily this game has the next best thing
7. **Timer** I really wish there was a way for me to win without having to touch the other player, luckily this game has a timer
8. **Command Inputs** As a FGC Nerd I really like when I have to press a bunch of crazy buttons to do something that should be simple, luckily this game has command inputs!

## Technologies to be used
Godot which uses GDScript and the Godot Shader Language to run was all that was used. From Godot you can export the project to an exe or a MacOS app
or even an html5 webpage.
