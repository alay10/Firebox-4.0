## Background
 People who play video games and fighting games. Many people love games and would play an indie game with some simple mechanics
## Project Overview
A video game with fighting game mechanics. We wanted to have a fireball, over head and a parry. This means that the user would be able to attack from a range with a fireball. A overhead would offer them something to mix their opponent. A parry would allow for a very powerful defensive option so that the player can attack back when being oppressed by the offense.
