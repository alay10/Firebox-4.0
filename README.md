### Tutorial
The game is a basic fighting game, you can rebind your controls in the options menu.
You move left and right based on that and can jump with up and crouch with down.



There are six attacks and four defensive options we have

> #### Dashing
> Double tap a direction to dash in that direction. 
> You can jump out of this to perform a dash jump.
> If you press up at the same time as your dash you can perform an Instant Dash Jump or IDJ

> #### Punch
> To perform this attack simply press the attack button without holding any directions.
> It is a quick but stubby move.

> #### Block
> To block an attack simply hold away from your opponent.
> Doing so will allow you to block attacks while still sustaining some knockback

> #### Kick
> To perform this attack press the attack button while crouching or holding down.
> This is a low sweep and is able to break through standard block.

> #### Low Block
> To perform this action hold down and away from your opponent.
> This will allow you to block almost all attacks that are performed on the ground

> #### Jump Punch
> To perform this attack hold forwards and press the attack button at the same time.
> This move works as a low block call out as it will break through a low block.
> However a standard block will stop the attack.

> #### Firebox
> To perform this attack you need to rapidly press down, then down and forward, forward, then the attack button in quick succession.
> Or a quarter circle input to those familar with fighting games.
> This moves allows you to shoot out a fireball from long distances. 
> It can be blocked with both blocks.

> #### Air Kick
> To perform this attack simply press the attack button while in the air.
> This move can be blocked by a standard block and serves as an excellent counter to a fireball

> #### Uppercut
> To perform this attack you to need to rapidly press forwards, then down, then down and forwards, then the attack button in quick succession.
> Or a shoryuken input to those familar with fighting games.
> This move works when grounded and cancels all other actions you are taking 
> The move lifts you off the ground with a rising attack that does double damage to opponents.
> This move is a great counter to an opponent who is jumping in with an air kick.

> #### Parry
> To perfom this press forwards within 6 frames of an opponents attack hitting you.
> This will make you flash blue and freezes you opponent.

### **Style Guide and standards for Development:**

**All Changes should be commit'd to your own branch and then merged into the main in order to prevent accidental conflicts**
Merges should be overseen by a **minimum of two people** counting the author of the branch.
Before overwriting someone else's code on main you should double check your changes with them


We will just be using the Godot reccomended style guide found [here.](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html)
